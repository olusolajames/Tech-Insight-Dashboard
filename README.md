I recently worked on a project that involves using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create three dashboards.
Current Technology Usage tab containing:
1.	Top 10 Languages 
2.	Top 10 Databases 
3.	Platforms 
4.	Top 10 WebFrames
   
A Future Technology Trends tab containing:
1. Top 10 Languages desired for the next year 
2. Top 10 Databases desired for the next year 
3. Desired platforms for the next year 
4. Top 10 WebFrames desired for the next year 

A Demographics tab containing:
1. Respondent classified by gender 
2. Respondent count for countries 
3. Respondent count by age 
4. Respondent count by gender and classified by education level

Here is the link to the dashboards.
