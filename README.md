I recently worked on a project that involves using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 data to create three dashboards.
Current Technology Usage tab containing:
1.	Top 10 Languages 
2.	Top 10 Databases 
3.	Platforms 
4.	Top 10 WebFrames
   
A Future Technology Trends tab containing:
•	Top 10 Languages desired for the next year 
•	Top 10 Databases desired for the next year 
•	Desired platforms for the next year 
•	Top 10 WebFrames desired for the next year 

A Demographics tab containing:
•	Respondent classified by gender 
•	Respondent count for countries 
•	Respondent count by age 
•	Respondent count by gender and classified by education level
